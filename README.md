## Purpose / Syfte
The purpose of the project is to upply what we learned, which is
html5 css3 and javascript but mostly focused on javascript.

## Procedures / Genomfšrande
The result can be reproduced by using multiple javascript files instead
of just one main.js.
A problem i had was the language settings and how to store the information
and refresh the page in the end i remembered to use sessionstorage.
another problem i had was trying to find a free short audio for error
and i found Base64 audio, which i converted to mp3 and used in my javascript.

## Discussion / Diskussion
i learned alot of javascript and what was the most difficult was
language settings,
which i soolved using sessionstorage.
